# AGENTS.md

SourceHut connector written in Harn. It verifies Ed25519-signed webhooks and
exposes GraphQL plus raw HTTP helpers.

Shared connector authoring rules live in the Harn guide:

- [Connector authoring guide](https://github.com/burin-labs/harn/blob/main/docs/src/connectors/authoring.md)

Put shared connector guidance in the Harn guide and keep only
provider-specific notes and local hazards here.

`CLAUDE.md` points here. Edit `AGENTS.md` only.

## Provider notes

- Webhook event names use `x-sourcehut-event`; delivery IDs use `x-sourcehut-delivery` or
  `x-srht-delivery`.
- Signed SourceHut webhooks use Ed25519 public-key verification, not an HMAC signing secret.
- Outbound calls default to the SourceHut GraphQL endpoint and accept OAuth2 tokens or PATs through
  call args, `sourcehut/api-token`, `SOURCEHUT_TOKEN`, or `SOURCEHUT_API_TOKEN`.

## Pull request titles

Use `[Area] Sentence case`. The area is one of `Connector`, `CI`, or `Docs`.

- `[Connector] Reject webhook deliveries with a stale timestamp`
- `[CI] Repin the shared Harn package workflow`
- `[Docs] Describe the poll cursor contract`

Keep the title on one line, under about 70 characters. Say what changed, not
which files moved. Capitalize the first word after the bracket and leave the
rest in sentence case.

`CONTRIBUTING.md` states the contribution policy for this repository.

<!-- BEGIN HARN SHARED AGENT CONTRACT: managed by harn-bump-fleet -->

## Ecosystem working agreement

- Build ambitious outcomes behind small typed interfaces; give behavior one owner
  and generate or parity-test projections instead of duplicating policy.
- Work autonomously within approved scope. Pause for destructive or production effects,
  exceptional spend, material ambiguity, or new authority.
- Treat stop, wait, stand down, pivot, and steer as control events.
- Use the smallest owning product-path check. Add a falsifier for contested, load-bearing,
  or potentially vacuous claims; record controls, recovery, and blind spots.
- Evidence follows source/artifact identity. Reuse proof when relevant code, build inputs,
  and dependencies are unchanged. Repeat affected checks for relevant changes, failures,
  deployment, or packaging differences. Do not rebuild or recapture solely for main.
- Ship means owning-main integration with terminal merge and applicable release/deploy
  checks. Confirm landed content and result; an open PR is incomplete.
- Use `ship` with a deployed Smart Ship caller; otherwise use `gh pr merge --squash --auto`.
  Never use `--admin`; incidents use `bypass-ci`, `bypass-merge-queue`, or `force-merge`.
